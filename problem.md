i really need to stop thinking that i need peoples approval inorder for them to accept me.
i just be nice to everyone thinking what will they think of me or not accept me as their friend
This constant chase for approval is killing any real personality i've got because im too busy molding yourself to fit-in.
im working on this these days ... i need to stop being like this and be authentic with people 

_# Advice for someone who also struggles with this:_
you don’t owe anyone a sugar-coated, “nice” version of yourself. (be good and polite but dont be a doormat)
People respect confidence and authenticity way more than endless politeness.
