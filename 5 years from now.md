well ... this question gets asked alot by people, where do you see yourself 5 years from now, yesterday while I was on my way home on metro i had a time to think about it 
well it was just usual .. working on my job ... doing a project that would make an impact (hopefully) ... going for masters abroad, getting that out of country experience and living alone typa thing
then after just graduating i though that i would still probably look for a job better than the previous one .. then a thought occured to me i seem to see everyone has THAT something that would do THAT
well these days everyone seems to just go in a bussiness, do their own thing, ill be honest i dont see myself doing that maybe my mind might change but rn its not 

i would probably want to be where im helping out the people by something thats related to my skill or maybe it dosnt have to be my skill (which is AI engineer stuff) but the point is i wanna help people
cause ... it makes me feel good .. i feel a sense of purpose and fullfilment ... its good for my soul. so i think its aight 

but ..... i feel in the back of my head that theres still a blank statement left out, like fill in the blanks, i guess ill figure it out on the way, ohhhh one thing i forgot to add, its traveling, wanna see some 
cool things, visit new places hopefully with some good company

maybe ill come back to this and maybe my views perception thinking goals and priorities might have changed
